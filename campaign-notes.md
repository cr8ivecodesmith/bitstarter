### The Goals of Philippine Education

Education is a basic human right that helps an idividual's physical, 
intellectual, and moral development with the goal of freeing themselves 
from the limiting implications of poverty, ignorance and other 
socioeconomic circumstances.

It also drives and individual to develop a sense of Patriotism and 
Nationalism which are qualities that help shape our nation's future 
leaders.

### The Affordability of Philippine Education

Our government provides free basic education and even subsidizes college 
education. But even free or subsidized education is unsustainable for most 
Filipino. 

Statistics show that out of 10 students who enter grade 1: 7 will finish 
elementary, 3 will finish highschool, and only 1 will finish college. 

A major reason is poverty. 

In hindsight, most parents have their hands full in providing their 
children with food, clothing, and shelter than worry about school expenses.

Imagine if our nation's youth can reach their full potential. 

Education is one key aspect to help our youth reach their full potential.

Our government provides free primary and secondary education and even subsidizes tertiary education.

But even free or subsidized education is unsustainable for most.
Fare, uniform, allowance, project and classroom materials, etc.
